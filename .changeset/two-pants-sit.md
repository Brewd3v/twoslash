Three main things:

- Playground: entirely new set of user-centered docs for understanding how to make a Shiki Twoslash code sample
- Annotations: A way to provide meta-commentary on code in a code sample
- Logging: Abuse the trust your users have in your code samples by using first-class primitives for showing logs

The major bump is because I changed the codefence highlighting syntax to be similar to the IDE's line numbers, they start at 1, not 0.

See the docs: in https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/playground
